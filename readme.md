Bellota & Bellota Text font families
==============================

Bellota is an ornamented, low contrast sans-serif with swash alternates. It’s just cute enough!


It comes in two subfamilies: **Bellota** and **Bellota Text**. Each of these comes in 9 weights (thin, extralight, light, regular, medium, semibold, bold, extrabold, black) with their corresponding italics. Bellota also comes as a variable font. 

Bellota has stylistic alternate sets and ligatures available through opentype features.

* Stylistic Style1: Text
* Stylistic Style 2: Swash caps

Bellota supports most latin languages and basic cyrillic

Bellota is based on the font "Snippet" by Gesine Todt (www.gesine-todt.de)

# License	  
The **Bellota Family** is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License Version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL). The Open Font License is a free software license, and as such permits the fonts to be used, modified, and distributed freely (so long as the resulting fonts remain under the Open Font License). 

In other words, you are free to use it for any purpose, commercial included.

If you remix or modify the font, I'd love to hear about it!.

# Build
Because Bellota uses components that `fontmake` cannot currently build (as of Jan. 2020) such as corner components, we’re using a partially automated build process.
To generate correct TTFs, export TTFs directly out of Glyphs.app (remove overlaps, autohint), then run the partial build script `build.sh` to change a few things regarding the hinting settings.
