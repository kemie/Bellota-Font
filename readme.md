Bellota Font Family
==============================
![Bellota cover](http://www.pixilate.com/roots/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bellota1.png)

Bellota is an ornamented, low contrast sans-serif with text and swash alternates. Itâ€™s just cute enough!

It comes in two variations: regular and text. Each of these comes in tree weights (light/regular/bold) and italics. There are stylistic alternates (for swash and non-ornamented characters) and ligatures available through opentype features.
Stylistic Style1: Text
Stylistic Style 2: Swash caps

Bellota supports most latin. languages and basic cyrillic

Bellota is based on the font "Snippet" by Gesine Todt (www.gesine-todt.de)

# Build
To generate correct TTFs, export TTFs directly out of Glyphs.app (remove overlaps, autohint), then run the partial build script `build.sh` to change a few things regarding the hinting settings.
