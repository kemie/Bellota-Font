————————————————————————————————

This file provides detailed information on the Bellota Font Family.

This information should be distributed along with the Bellota fonts and any derivative works.



Basic Font Information
————————————————————————————————

Bellota is an ornamented, low contrast sans-serif with text and swash alernates. It’s just cute enough!

It comes in two variations: regular and text. Each of these comes in tree weights (light/regular/bold) and italics. It has stylistic alternates (for swash and non-ornamented characters) and ligatures available through opentype features.
Stylistic Style1: Text
Stylistic Style 2: Swash caps

Bellota is based on the font "Snippet" by Gesine Todt (www.gesine-todt.de)
