 Bellota is an ornamented, low contrast sans-serif with swash alternates. Itâ€™s just cute enough!</p>

<p>It comes in two subfamilies: Bellota and Bellota Text. Each of these comes in 9 weights (thin, extralight, light, regular, medium, semibold, bold, extrabold, black) with their corresponding italics. Bellota is available as a variable font with a width axis.</p>

<p>Bellota has stylistic alternate sets and ligatures available through opentype features and supports most latin languages and basic cyrillic</p>

<p>Bellota is based on the font "Snippet" by Gesine Todt</p>
